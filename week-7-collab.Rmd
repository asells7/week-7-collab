Hey its week 7... woot! I'm tired

Hey Alison! I'm right there with you, looking forward to Thanksgiving :-)

Yes, so am I!
Also this is very strange but the chat button wont let me message just you. Very weird

Okay no worries! Haha 
This collab tool is pretty cool.. glad we got it down. See you around!
